  From cybersec, to reading sci-fi and fantasy, to throwing around multi-sided polyhedral objects with numerical indicators, there's a lot that I enjoy doing.

      I haven't been playing for very log, but a good game is tough to beat.  Even better when I'm DMing said game.  Building the story for others is an amazing feeling.

      Words = good.  Words on lots of pages bound together = better.  Fantasy or Sci-Fi = even more betterer.

      I spent many years camping when I was younger and it's something I'm working on getting back into now.  Give me a good tent and campfire and I'm a happy guy.

      What's better than camping?  Going camping when you have a clear view of the sky and brought a good telescope along!  Throw a camera on that telescope and you've got a good time on your hands.

      Did you know that cameras could be used to take pictures?  I learned that a while ago and then started doing it!  Rounding out my list of hobbies is general photography, but mostly of the landscape variety.
