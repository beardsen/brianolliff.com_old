## FINALLY

I finally was able to get this site working how I wanted and customized to my liking.  Mostly.

There's still a handful of things that I may want to change down the line.  And by down the line I probably mean tomorrow.

Regardless, it was an interesting journey and quite a learning experience.  Prior to working on this site, I had never even heard of Hugo or Netlify, and had barely ever done anything with GitHub.  This project took me down a long road on all of them and then some.  The only part of this entire endeavor that I was familiar with was Cloudflare.  But I learned a lot, went through a LOT of trial and error and troubleshooting, and will probably be doing a writeup of everything that I did to summarize and pass on ~~the savings~~ my failures to you!

But now I think it's time to go site outside and listen to the rain for a bit.  There's definitely something to be said for not sitting in front of a computer screen all day long.
