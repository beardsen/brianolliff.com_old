## Yes, I started a blog.

For quite a while now, I've been wanting to create a space where I can share my thoughts, my ideas, my rants, and anything else that may come to mind.  I've got projects I want to work on, and I want to share updates on those projects as well.  Some are D&D related, some are security related, and some aren't related to anything specific at all.  Well that makes no sense... everything's related to something, isn't it?

So I guess that's what will be happening here.  I may just type a string on consciousness that may not be spelled correctly, or perhaps I will have a well thought out document that is carefully prepared and edited before it gets posted here.  Only time will tell how this turns out, but what matters is that it will have content and I will enjoy doing it.

### Hello, world

So, hey everyone.  I'm Brian.

At the time of this writing, I'm 39 years old and live in the southeastern US where it's hot and humid.  I've been working in IT for about 15ish years now and for the past 5-6 years, I've been focused mainly on cyber security.  Before that, I did a good mix of server and network administration with a healthy dose of Exchange (email) admin in there as well.  I was married for a little over 6 years before separating and am now going through the divorce.  Fun times, right?

In my free time, I enjoy playing Dungeons & Dragons - and by playing, I mean mostly DMing (running) the games.  I've been working on creating my own world and adventure to go along with it, but that is a slow and complicated process - but enjoyable.  I've got two games going on at the moment, one on Monday nights that is getting ready to wrap up (and then start a new campaign) and another on Thursday nights that is barely a month old.  The Thursday night one is streamed on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/beardsengaming) (most of the time) and also uploaded to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTSO4xg2aIkKwILGBKOn37Q) within a couple of days.  I'm working on turning the D&D thing into a side hustle, but still working out the details of that.

And yes, I am still one of those people who put two spaces after the end of a sentence.  I was raised in simpler times, when that was the rule.  And I will continue to do so.  Does that annoy you yet?

Wait. Can you even tell the difference here? Oh no.

So that's me in a nutshell ("Help, help.  I'm in a nutshell").  I'm sure there will be more little tidbits that come out over the next (insert arbitrary time period here).
